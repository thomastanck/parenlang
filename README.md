Introduction
------------

This is paren, a Lisp with a lisp.

The only two syntactic characters are ( and ). All other characters
are treated as comments.

Summary
-------

The idea behind paren is to use nested parens to define operators and
numbers. These operators and numbers are then used like in Lisp, but
since I don't actually know Lisp it'll basically be a stupid version
of Lisp.

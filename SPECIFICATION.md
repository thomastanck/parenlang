paren Specification
===================

Introduction
------------

paren, as its name suggests, relies heavily on parens (parentheses). It's a not
so subtle nod to Lisp's so called `crazy brackets`. It turns out however, that
`crazy brackets` aren't so bad, as paren is a perfectly readable language
especially suitable for systems and web programming.

Character set
-------------

paren's philosophy is simplicity and power. The simpler something is, the fewer
bugs it has, and chances are, the faster it'll run. In a similar vein, the more
powerful a language is, the more extensible it is, the more freedom you will get
as a programmer, and the more efficient you will be. paren is designed with
these two goals in mind, and is now the fastest, most error resistant, and most
efficient language.

This is why paren only uses two characters in its character set. `(` and `)`, as
having more characters only increases the chances of a typo and easily creates
crashing builds, which is obviously no good. All other characters raise an error
in development as paren adopts a fail-fast philosophy. However, in production,
non parens are gracefully handled by the interpreter and thus will not crash
your services if a developer accidentally commits a stray non paren.
